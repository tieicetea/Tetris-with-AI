# Tetris-Python-w-AI


To run the code, download the files and run the ThaiTris file, that is the main file. board.py contains all the game mechanics and mechanisms that allow the game to run. Tetrominos.py and GhostTetros.py contain the code defining both the ghost block and the normal tetrominoes (the block used in tetris, called this because of their 4 nature). Block.py defines the specifications of a singular block, which then builds into the tetrominoes and the ghost tetros. By editing the tickspeed found in ThaiTris.py, you can determine speed at which the game is played.
